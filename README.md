[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/COS301-SE-2022/Grid-Watch/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://coveralls.io/github/COS301-SE-2022/Grid-Watch?branch=develop)

### Project Description
The grid watch system will allow three core interfaces:

1. The first interface will allow anyone with access to the application (the public) to report and monitor power failures, potholes, water supply shortages and other issues in each location which need to be investigated and repaired. Locations should receive notifications based on if a problem in their area may affect them. 
2. The second interface will allow Authorized officials a view of all the publicly created tickets and the option to dispatch a technical team or start a bidding process where third party service providers can obtain the tender to do the work the specific ticket requires. 
3. The third interface will allow the tech team to report on the ticket information such as the cost of the repair, a detailed description of the problem and how it is going to be fixed with the estimated time it will take to complete these repairs. 

The system will also make use of predictive analytics powered by AI modules that will predict certain aspects such as potential problems that may be experienced as a result of the weather or ticket repair information based on what similar tickets have costed and the time they took to repair in the past.
