  <div class="container mt-3 mb-3">
    The vision of this project is to provide a customer relationship manager for a citizen who would like to report and receive feedback on a municipal issue that they are experiencing in their area. The goal is to provide an easy to follow, consistently updated, system that will serve as a way for a customer to keep track of their issues and a management system for city officials and technician teams trying to resolve the issue.

  The need for this application is seen daily. With multiple reports of hundreds of "check-up" calls happening daily on our municipal grid (2000 Calls Linked to Power Outages, Electrical Outage Results in 800 calls, Power Outage Results in 3000 Calls) the need for a system which can streamline this process is almost essential. We intend to provide a ticketing system which allows for this check-up system with some automated features.
